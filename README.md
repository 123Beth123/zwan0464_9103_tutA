# In this artwork

The use of abstract lines and dotted patterns with rich color hierarchy demonstrates a unique sense of visual tension and rhythm. This presentation, especially through the repetitive use of colors and shapes, creates a combination of movement and order that can inspire my design research.

## Application to Interaction Design

Specifically, I can apply this patterning effect to interaction design to achieve a similar visual effect through dynamically generated colors and geometric shapes. Considering the requirements of the assignment, this technique helps to convey visual appeal and hierarchy of user experience in the design.

## Coding Technique Exploration

To implement the dynamic generation of colors and geometric patterns, the p5.js library is an ideal tool. It provides simple functions for creating shapes, while the `random()` function allows for the randomization of colors and forms, emulating abstract art. This technique facilitates the creation of dynamic, visually captivating designs through minimal code, making it perfect for real-time interaction design.
